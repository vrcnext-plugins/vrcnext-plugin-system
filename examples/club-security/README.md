# Club Security

Reports who joins your instance, and whether they meet your club's rules.

Everything that varies per club is a **preset**: which instances it watches, what it expects of a
joiner, and where its reports go. A join is reported once per enabled preset whose filters match
the instance, so one account can run the door for several clubs at once.

Every report carries a verdict, and it is the worst of the preset's checks:

| Verdict | Means |
| :--- | :--- |
| ✅ green | Every requirement was checked and holds. |
| ⚠️ orange | Something could not be checked: an unknown avatar rank, a hidden age status, a membership the player does not show publicly. |
| ⛔ red | A requirement was checked and does not hold: a VeryPoor avatar under a Medium floor, a verified account that is not 18+, a non-friend where friendship is required. |

The verdict reaches your templates as `{result}`, `{resultText}`, `{resultEmoji}` and
`{resultColor}` — the last one colours the Discord embed's bar.

## A preset

| Section | Setting | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Identity | Preset name, Enabled | The name appears in every report as `{preset}`. |
| Filters | Instance types, Group, Worlds | One of each kind. Empty means "any". A pickable group and worlds, not pasted ids. |
| Requirements | Require 18+, PC / Quest avatar rank at least, Must be a member of, Must be on my friend list | Each one becomes a check with its own verdict. |
| Channels | In-app toast, Desktop, VR overlay, Discord | Per preset, so a strict club can post to Discord while a relaxed one only toasts. |
| Formats | Report template, VR overlay template, Discord embed | The text report, the plain-text one for VR, and the embed. |

## The default report

```
✅ Tupper joined · Saturday Night
✅ 18+ verified: 18+
✅ PC avatar rank: Good
✅ Group member: member
Avatar: Ava (PC Good · Quest Poor)
```

First line = title, rest = body. A line whose placeholders all came out empty is left out, which
is why the rejoin line only appears for someone who has been in that instance before.

`{name}` is short for `{{ name }}`; the full template language (conditions, filters, `{% if %}`
blocks) is in the plugin system's API reference. The VR template is separate because WayVR draws
with a single font and shows nothing for emoji.

| Kind | Variables |
| :--- | :--- |
| Verdict | `result` `resultText` `resultEmoji` `resultColor` `checksText` `checksPlainText` `failedText` `unverifiedText` |
| Player | `name` `playerId` `platform` `platformEmoji` `isFriend` `friendText` `ageVerified` `ageVerifiedText` `ageVerifiedEmoji` `ageStatus` |
| Avatar | `avatar` `avatarId` `avatarImageUrl` `pcRank` `pcRankText` `pcRankEmoji` `questRank` `questRankText` `questRankEmoji` |
| Club | `preset` `inGroup` `inGroupText` `inGroupEmoji` |
| History | `rejoin` `rejoinText` `rejoinEmoji` `rejoinAgo` `rejoinSince` `rejoinAt` |
| Place and time | `world` `worldId` `instanceType` `instanceId` `location` `time` `date` `timestamp` |

Booleans (`ageVerified`, `inGroup`, `rejoin`, `isFriend`) are empty when unknown, so
`{{ "yes" if rejoin else "no" }}` and `{% if inGroup == false %}…{% endif %}` both behave. A
template that does not parse is reported in the log and the default is used instead.

## Where each fact comes from

Everything goes through `ctx.vrchat`, which reads VRCNext's data **without opening its dialogs**.

| Fact | Source | Caveat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 18+ verification | The joiner's profile. `18+` passes, `verified` without `18+` fails, `hidden` or missing is unverified. | Legacy accounts without a `usr_` id cannot be looked up at all. |
| Avatar and ranks | The avatar the player wears, resolved through VRCNext's avatar databases, then its performance ranks. | Only works when one of the databases knows the avatar; an unknown rank is unverified, never a failure. |
| Group membership | The groups the user shows publicly. | A member who hides the membership is unverified, not a failure. |
| Friendship | Your friend list. | — |
| Rejoin | VRCNext's timeline: the player's ten most recent events, each with its location. Yes when one of them is this exact instance (same world **and** instance id) from before this join. | Survives restarts and reaches back to when VRCNext was installed, but only ten events deep per player. |

Each lookup runs in parallel and degrades to "unknown" on its own timeout rather than holding up
the report.

## Your own joins

The signed-in account comes from `ctx.vrchat.self()`. VRChat logs an `OnPlayerJoined` line for the
local player too, and right after it one line for every player already in the instance. The plugin
ignores your own line and treats joins inside the settle window after it (or after a world change)
as "already here".

## Layout and permissions

Flat, like every plugin: `plugin.json`, `main.ts`, `src/`. The manifest declares `gamelog` (joins
and world changes), `vrchat` (the read-only data above), `notifications` (toast, Windows tray
toast), `native` (bridge targets) and `network` with `discord.com` as its only host. No VRCNext
actions and no raw events: the `vrchat` capability covers everything this plugin reads.
